## Next Steps (Continuing Phase 2: Service Layer)

1. **Complete Remaining Service Layer Tests**
   - Implement tests for services/settings.py
   - Implement tests for services/chat_users.py
   - Implement tests for services/chat_permissions.py
   - Add complete mock service tests to all service modules

2. **Model Layer Enhancement**
   - Improve test coverage for models/settings.py

## Challenges & Solutions

1. **Module Initialization Code**
   - Solution: Use direct function testing instead of patching imports
   - Simulate initialization process with controlled test functions

2. **Async Testing in Python 3.13**
   - Solution: Use AsyncMock with side_effect instead of return_value 
   - Create proper async wrapper functions for expected awaitable results
   - Use context managers to properly handle async code flow

3. **Service Layer Mocking**
   - Solution: Create specialized mock functions for each service component
   - Mock database results using AsyncMock and proper async patterns

## Overall Project Progress

- Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure) is complete (approx. 95% coverage)
- Phase 2 (Service Layer) is in progress (25% complete)
- Core models are well covered (models: 90%, schemas: 100%)
- Total test coverage is now at approximately 75% for the core components
